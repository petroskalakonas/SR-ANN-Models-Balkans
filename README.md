# Seismic-Vulnerability-ANN-Models-for-the-Balkans
This repository contains artificial neural network models ,developed in Python using the Tensorflow library, for the predicition of structural response, damage and economic loss due to seismic events of common building typologies in the Balkan region. These models can be used for scenario or probabilistic seismic risk assessment.
